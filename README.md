## üìç Additional information

### Filter on hover

```css
.card__image:hover {
  transform: scale(1.25);
  cursor: pointer;
  filter: hue-rotate(45deg);
}
```

### Make items undraggable

Discovered (via Google) a way to make items undraggable

```css
.card__image {
  -webkit-user-drag: none;
}
```

### Resize images without jumping out of frame

Finally found a way to resize images so they don't jump out of the frame

I placed the image in a container and set `overflow: hidden;` for the container

### Hue animation on hover

```css
.card__image:hover {
  transform: scale(1.25);
  cursor: pointer;
  filter: hue-rotate(45deg);
}

.card__image:active {
  transform: scale(1);
}
```
